Scraping LinkedIn for Jobs posted by Companies (Using Scrapy or Selenium)
Steps: -
Go to careerguide.com (or any other website of your choice where you can find job types). Scrape Job types from there. Subcategories divided by Categories.For eg:(Education->Tutor, Design and Art->Architect)
URL : https://www.careerguide.com/career-options
 
Then you have to go to LinkedIn and scrape the jobs from there under the category you scraped from caeerguide which will be under a state 
(State -> category of job -> job)
